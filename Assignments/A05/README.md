> This is your object definition....

#### Method
> This is your method definition.....




#### Abstraction
> Abstraction is cutting out the nonimportant details and only displaying essential data
#### Attributes / Properties
> leaves a note for the compiler providing additional info about the code
#### Class
> a class is a set of instructions that make up a user defined variable
#### Class Variable
> a member of a class used to represent a value 
#### Composition
> a class that references one or multiple objects that belong to other classes 
#### Constructor
> a function within a class that declares each class object with default parameters
#### Encapsulation
> binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data protecting them from outside interference 
#### Friends
> a function defined outside of class, but that has access to all member variables private or not
#### Inheritance
> one object is passed all the properties of its parent object
#### Instance Variable
> a variable defined within a class, but outside of constructors or methods 
#### Member Variable
> a variable that is associated with a specific object
#### Method
> functions that belong to a class
#### Multiple Inheritance
> when a class inherits properties from more than one base class
#### Object
> an instance of a class. no memory is allocated for an object until it is initialized
#### Overloading
> creating functions with the same name but different parameters 
#### Polymorphism
> when multiple classes are related to each other by inheritance
#### Public / Private / Protected
> public variables are accessible by the entire program, private members are only accessible by methods of the class and friends of the class, protected members are
> kept safe from outside interference or manipulation 
#### Static
> the static keyword gives variables a scope for the lifetime of the program
#### Virtual
> a function that is overrideden by a derived class after it has been defined in its base class
